Hello! I'm Jennifer, an engineer with a robust foundation in mechanical design and robotics. 
I earned my a Master of Science in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2024, where I was advised by 
[Prof. Zeynep Temel](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zeynep-temel/) at the [Zoom Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/zoom-lab/).
I also completed my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at CMU in 2023.

During my masterâ€™s program, I developed an omnidirectional quadruped robot, delving into robot simulation, trajectory optimization, and gait analysis. 
At [Gecko Robotics](https://www.geckorobotics.com/), I designed and built a dedicated testing unit, which enhanced my skills in user-centric device development.
Additionally, I have worked on complex mechanical systems, such as the bellcranks and dampers system for an FSAE racecar built by [Carnegie Mellon Racing](https://www.carnegiemellonracing.org/).

My strengths include working with diverse teams, hands-on prototyping, and turning complex ideas into practical, user-focused solutions.
My aim is to innovate and continually expand my skill set through working on mechanical design, robot development, and project leadership.

**I'm actively seeking opportunities in mechanical engineering, robotics, or related fields. 
If you would like to learn more about my prior experience, please refer to my [resume](/assets/pdf/Jennifer_Yang_Resume.pdf) or take a look at some of my [projects](/projects/). Enjoy!**
