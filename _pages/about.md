Hello! My name is Jennifer. I'm an engineer looking for a role in robotics, mechanical engineering, or anything inbetween. 
I enjoy solving engineering problems hands-on and collaborating with peers to c

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024 with a Master of Science in Robotics. 
At CMU, I was advised by [Prof. Zeynep Temel](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zeynep-temel/). 
For my masters, I built an omnidirectional, quadruped robot and investigated walking gaits for the robot.
I also completed my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at CMU in May 2023.

During that time, I designed and prototyped a posture enhancing chair, worked as a resident assistant in the dorms, and organized multiple career fairs with the Society of Women Engineers. 
I also engineered multiple systems for Carnegie Mellon Racing: the bellcranks and dampers system for the racecar suspension and a simulation rig for testing driver ergonomics and training drivers. 
I have interned at Gecko Robotics, where I developed a testing unit for a
