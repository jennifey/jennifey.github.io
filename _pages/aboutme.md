I discovered my passion for engineering and robotics back in high school with FIRST Robotics Team 997. 
Transforming a simple concept into a functioning robot felt like pure magic. 
It was amazing to see what I learned in class come to life in real-world designs.

When I’m not focused on engineering, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me busy. 
I enjoy being creative, and I used to draw and paint. 
Recently, I’ve taken up crocheting. 
I started with amigurumi kits from the Woobles and then moved on to crafting accessories. 
Now, I'm tackling my first sweater and looking forward to learning knitting and sewing to create more clothing.

I also really enjoy baking and cooking.
I’m working on compiling my favorite recipes into a personal cookbook. 
I especially enjoy making Chinese pastries, though garlic bread is a close second.

In the winter time, I enjoy skiing and snowboarding. 
I've been skiing since I was a child and started snowboarding later.
I would like to branch out into more active hobbies that are available year-round.
Recently, I've been interested in dancing and rock climbing.
I would also like to return to martial arts. I hold a first-degree black belt in Taekwondo. 

And here’s a fun fact: One of my goals is to hug a panda!
