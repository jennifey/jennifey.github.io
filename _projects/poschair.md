In my undergraduate capstone project, I collaborated with four teammates to develop the PosChair, a posture enhancing chair. 

I focused on the design and implementation of the haptic feedback system, utilizing rapid prototyping and conducting user studies to refine the system for optimal intuitiveness.

    Haptic Feedback System

We integrated posture detection using infrared sensors to detect back angle. 
We initially used ultrasonic sensor but found the results to be too noisy.
We also implemented weight distribution detection with load cells.

The haptic feedback system was supplemented with a visual feedback system for both the sensing systems.

These systems were all packaged into a chair as our final prototype.

The prototypeâ€™s safety was rigorously tested through thermal, stress, battery life, and material analyses. 
Additionally, we prepared a mass-manufacturing plan with a cost estimate and performed failure mode and life cycle analyses. 
Our final prototype received positive feedback from users, validating the effectiveness of our design.
