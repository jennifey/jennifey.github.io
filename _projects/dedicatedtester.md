I interned at [Gecko Robotics](https://www.geckorobotics.com/) during summer 2022 and stayed on as a part-time employee during the 2022-2023 school year.
While I was there, I worked on the TOKA 4 robot, pictured below.

The TOKA 4 robot is complex with many subsystems, one of them being the Center Body (CB) of the robot
(the main body of the robot, as pictured above with the clear case).
However, one of the pain points during the build process for each fleet of robots
and troubleshooting robots that failed in the field was the lack of dedicated resources for verifying the CB.
This caused bottlenecks in the build process as it would be unclear when problems that arose were due to the CB
or the components being used to test the center body. So, my primary project during my time at Gecko was building a dedicated testing unit for the CB. 

I designed a user-centered device by communicating constantly with the primary users of the device.
This way, I was able to adapt the device better to their needs. 
For example, one import aspect was the ergonomics of the device components.
I utilized rapid prototyping to create multiple iterations of the components, had the users test it, and incorporated their feedback into my final design. 
I also performed thermal testing on certain components of the system to ensure that it would be able to withstand continuous use without risk of overheating and damaging components. 

The final product was very well received, and is estimated to have saved 200+ hours during the build cycle for the TOKA 4 fleet. 
Unfortunately I cannot show any pictures of the device, as that has not been publicized by Gecko Robotics.
