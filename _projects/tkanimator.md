For 15112, Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, I created a paint software.
It is also capable of animating videos and extracting frames from a video to reverse-animate it. 
This software was built in Python and uses the following libraries: tkinter, pil, and cv2. 
To learn more about this program, please see the demo video below.
