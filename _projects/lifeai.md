When I was taking 16735, Ethics and Robotics, we discussed the ethics of using AI and the impact of AI on creativity. 
At the end of the semester, we were each challenged to create something that related AI and creativity using AI. 

The goal of my piece is to explore the power dynamic between AI and humanity and investigate the possibility of over-reliance on AI and its effects.
I decided to create a piece that explored the possibility of a future where everyone relies on AI, even for the simplest decisions.
For example, AI might just tell you how to go about your day and you follow it entirely. 

As someone who enjoys creating art, I thought it would be interesting to combine digital art and generative AI art.
I used ChatGPT for initial brainstorming and to generate example conversations between the AI and the user. 
I used Dall-E to generate reference images for nonexistent concepts.
I used WOMBO Dream to generate illustrations for each panel using reference images, both generated and stock.
And I used Looka Logo Maker to generate the logo for the LifeAI software.
