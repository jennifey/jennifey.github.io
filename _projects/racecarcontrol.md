I worked with 2 teammates on developing a cost-optimized control pipeline for Carnegie Mellon Racing as my final project for Math Fundamentals for Robotics.

The original pipeline was a sequential set of controllers that have conflicting goals. 
Each controller returns its optimal solution, but final solution isnâ€™t necessarily the optimal combination of solutions.

The optimized pipeline produced 4-wheel torque-vectored results that are optimized across all the vehicle constraints.

The simulations demonstrate a 90% improvement on reaching the target yaw moment while maintaining a less than 5% impact on realized linear acceleration and power consumption. 
This pipeline is currently being further developed by Carnegie Mellon Racing for use on future vehicles.
