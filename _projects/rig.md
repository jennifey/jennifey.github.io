The Rig is driver simulation and ergonomics rig intended for driver training and ergonomics testing for [Carnegie Mellon Racing](https://www.carnegiemellonracing.org/).
It is primarily built from 8020 components to allow for adjustability so that it can be adapted to a large range sizes.

I led this project during Covid, when there was not enough work for new members to participate in since a lot of it required in person presence and we were finishing 20e, the car from the previous year.
This gave new members with an interest in joining Carnegie Mellon Racing a place to start on the team. 
I taught them 3D modeling in SolidWorks, making sure I taught them good CAD practices, and I taught them how to make drawings.

When we finally returned to campus in Fall 2021, we built the Rig and it has since been used to inform the design of future vehicles and provide driver training.
